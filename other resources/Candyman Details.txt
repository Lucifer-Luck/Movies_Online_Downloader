Skeptical graduate student Helen Lyle befriends Anne-Marie McCoy
while researching superstitions in a housing project on Chicago's
Near North Side. From Anne-Marie, Helen learns about the Candyman,
a knife-wielding figure of urban legend that some of her neighbors
believe to be responsible for a recent murder. After a mysterious
man matching the Candyman's description begins stalking her, Helen
comes to fear that the legend may be all too real.
