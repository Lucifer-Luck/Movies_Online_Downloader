Artemis Fowl is a 12-year-old genius and descendant of a
long line of criminal masterminds. He soon finds himself
in an epic battle against a race of powerful underground
fairies who may be behind his father's disappearance.

For some time, Artemis has been tracking down the existence
of the underground fairy world, getting his hands on a copy
of its Book of the People through an alcoholic sprite in Ho
Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He translates the gnommish runes and
uses the information to kidnap Lower Elements Police (LEP)
elite officer and fairy Holly Short, holding her to ransom
in his family's manor.
