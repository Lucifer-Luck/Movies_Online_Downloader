SYNOPSIS

Ray Garrison, an elite soldier who was killed in battle, is brought back to life by an
advanced technology that gives him the ability of super human strength and fast healing.
With his new abilities, he goes after the man who killed his wife, or at least, who he
believes killed his wife. He soon comes to learn that not everything he learns can be trusted.
The true question is: Can he even trust himself?



After he and his wife are murdered, marine Ray Garrison is resurrected by a team of scientists.
Enhanced with nanotechnology, he becomes a superhuman, biotech killing machine - Bloodshot.
As Ray first trains with fellow super-soldiers, he cannot recall anything from his former life.
But when his memories flood back and he remembers the man that killed both him and his wife,
he breaks out of the facility to get revenge, only to discover that there's more to the conspiracy
than he thought.
