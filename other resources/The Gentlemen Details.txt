Mickey Pearson is an American expatriate who became
rich by building a highly profitable marijuana empire
in London. When word gets out that he's looking to
cash out of the business, it soon triggers an array
of plots and schemes -- including bribery and
blackmail -- from shady characters who want to
steal his domain.
