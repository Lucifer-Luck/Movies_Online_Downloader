A twisted tale told by Harley Quinn herself, when Gotham's
most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and
his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl
named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.
Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya's paths collide,
and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up
to take Roman down.
