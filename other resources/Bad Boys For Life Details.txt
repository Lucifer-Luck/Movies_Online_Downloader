The wife and son of a Mexican drug lord embark on a
vengeful quest to kill all those involved in his
trial and imprisonment -- including Miami Detective
Mike Lowrey. When Mike gets wounded, he teams up with
partner Marcus Burnett and AMMO -- a special tactical
squad -- to bring the culprits to justice. But the
old-school, wisecracking cops must soon learn to get
along with their new elite counterparts if they are 
to take down the vicious cartel that threatens their lives.
