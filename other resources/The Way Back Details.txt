Jack Cunningham was a high school basketball superstar who
suddenly walked away from the game for unknown reasons. Years
later, he's now stuck in a meaningless job and struggling with
alcoholism - the very thing that ruined his marriage and his
hope for a better life. But Jack soon gets a shot at redemption
when he becomes the basketball coach for his alma mater, a
programme that has fallen on hard times since his teenage glory days.
