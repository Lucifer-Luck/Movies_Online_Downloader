A detective investigates a murder scene that has a connection to
a case that her new partner handled in the past. The killings
occurred in a haunted house that passes on a ghostly curse to
those who dare enter it. Soon, the curse spreads to a terminally
ill woman and her husband, and another unsuspecting couple who
were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
