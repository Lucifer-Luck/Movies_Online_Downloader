Vanguard is an internationally-renowned and privately-owned venture high-tech
security agency founded by Tang Huanting (Jackie Chan). Their client, Qin Guoli,
alerted the U.S. intelligence agencies of his boss, Maasym, as the leader of an
aggressive military group in the Middle East. Maasym is then assassinated by the
U.S. government and his son, Omar, ordered to have Qin captured. Vanguard members
Lei Zhenyu (Yang Yang), Zhang Haixuan (Ai Lun) and Miya (Mu Qimiya) are sent on
a mission to rescue Qin and to protect his estranged daughter, an elephant
conservationist, Fareeda (Xu Ruohan).
