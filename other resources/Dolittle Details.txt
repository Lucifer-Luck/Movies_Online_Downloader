Dr. John Dolittle lives in solitude behind the
high walls of his lush manor in 19th-century
England. His only companionship comes from an
array of exotic animals that he speaks to on a
daily basis. But when young Queen Victoria becomes
gravely ill, the eccentric doctor and his furry
friends embark on an epic adventure to a mythical
island to find the cure.
